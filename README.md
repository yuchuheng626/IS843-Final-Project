# Report Summary
In this study, we employed PySpark and Pandas to investigate pricing factors impacting US domestic flight fares. We conducted exploratory data analysis and implemented linear regression and random forest regression models. Our findings revealed that customers can achieve cost savings by opting for a non-refundable, direct flight ticket and initiating their search 45 days prior to the actual flight date. For future research, we recommend extending the dataset to encompass a full year and include international flight data. Additionally, given increased time and computing resources, we could explore additional regression models to enhance our analysis.

# Problem definition:
Our goal is to identify the key factors of flight prices between 04/16/2022 and 10/05/2022 to generate predictions for our customer.

To achieve this, we will use PySpark for EDA and regression modeling on a large-scale dataset of flight prices and related variables such as departure date, arrival date, airline, etc. Our primary goal will be to identify the factors that have the greatest impact on flight prices during this time period, and to see the strength of these relationships using statistical models.

Afterwards, we shall apply machine learning and regression techniques to develop insights for airfare costs relying on crucial components. These forecasts will offer customers perspectives concerning the ideal timing and price point when they should purchase plane tickets so as to make their expenses more efficient. By doing this, it is our intention to acquire a deeper knowledge of what prompts changes in flight fares.
